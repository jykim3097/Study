# 2018 Seoul Futur Conference (SFC)



Yesterday, I went to SFC.

Well, actually I didn't expect this event, but It was very useful to me.

So, I write down what I wrote yesterday, even briefly.



## first Speaker, Jae Seung Jung

### He said,

* If the world of online matches offline, we need a new economic concept.
  And that is the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

* He is studying a brainwave hat, which is changed pattern if thinking is changed.

  And in his laboratory, there is a robot that move as person thinks.

  The robot moves 93 times out of 100 without hitting the wall.
  I was surprised to hear this, because I felt that the age of robots would come faster.
  He said it meant that jobs would disappear even further.

  As AI only contributes to "production" not "consumption". I nodded.

  This means that capitalism is shaken.

  The gap between the rich and the poor in technology will widen.
  So we have to think about what humans have to do in such a world.
